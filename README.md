# README

MVP TO-DOS:
- set up userprofile COMPONENT / CRUD
    - CS navigation
- Route within memory details to edit memory 
    - Conditional only for user that created it
- Filter bar for memory type below search bar
- move navigation panel to left side
- make memories render as timeline display

Bugs:
- memory bank doesn't load without page refresh, useEffect in App.js needs to redirect in some way if user isn't authorized yet
- initial data load is an insanely long query to the db, adjust serializers depending on route

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
