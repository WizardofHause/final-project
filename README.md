# README

MVP TO-DOS:
- set up comment COMPONENT / CRUD
    - CS navigation
- set up userprofile COMPONENT / CRUD
    - CS navigation
- Route within memory details to edit memory 
    - Conditional only for user that created it
- Filter bar for memory type below search bar
- move navigation panel to left side
- make memories render as timeline display

Bugs:
- initial data load is an insanely long query to the db, set up custom serializers depending on route
- DELETE memory has an agreement issue with the id variable in App.js => function deletes the memory, but React still renders an error message to the console

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
